BUILD REQUIREMENTS
==================
UniMRCP depends on a number of third party tools and libraries,
which must be installed prior to UniMRCP build.

1. Apache Portable Runtime [1.2.x] (http://apr.apache.org/)
Whenever you want to build any part of UniMRCP, you need the
Apache Portable Runtime (APR) and the APR Utility (APR-util)
libraries.

GNU BUILD
===================
Additional requirements
- autoconf 2.57 or newer
- libtool 1.4 or newer

Build
$ ./bootstrap
$ ./configure
$ make
$ make install

There are a couple of options to "./configure".
To specify where to look for the APR and APR-util libraries
use the "--with-apr=" and "--with-apr-util=" options.
For example
$ ./configure --with-apr=/usr/local/apr \
              --with-apr-util=/usr/local/apr


To generate doxygen documentation from the sources use
$ make dox
Find output in docs/dox

To build distribution tarball use
$ make dist


WINDOWS BUILD
======================
Additional requirements
- Microsoft Visual Studio 2005

Build Preparation
You may need to adjust the paths for 3-rd party libraries
in appropriate property sheets to match your local installation,
while below are the defaults (build/vsprops).

apr.vsprops
	<UserMacro
		Name="AprDir"
		Value="$(SolutionDir)libs\apr"
	/>
	<UserMacro
		Name="AprUtilDir"
		Value="$(SolutionDir)libs\apr-util"
	/>
	
Build
Open unimrcp.sln and build it.
