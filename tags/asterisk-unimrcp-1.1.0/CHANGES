Changes for Asterisk UniMRCP Modules 1.1.0

1. Generic Speech Recognition API (res_speech_unimrcp.so)

    * Use the new NLSML parser interface to build ast_speech_result based on the parsed nlsml_result_t structure.
    * Added support for alternate interpretations (N-Best-List) as well as multiple instances per interpretation.

2. Dialplan Applications (app_unimrcp.so)

  2.1. MRCPSynth()

    * Added support for prompts referenced by a URI.
    * Differentiate the cases when synthesis is terminated due to an error or caller hang-up. In the latter case, the variable "SYNTHSTATUS" is set to the new status "INTERRUPTED".
    * Fixed a possible file handle leak.

  2.2. MRCPRecog()

    * Modified the default value of the option "i" (interrupt) in order to enable the DTMF support by default. In order to disable DTMFs, use the option i=disable. The other settings/values remain intact.
    * Added a new option "uer" (URI-encoded results). By default, this option is disabled (uer=0). If the option is enabled (uer=1), the variable "RECOG_RESULT" holds URI-encoded results. This matters in case of the AMI use.
    * If the application creation fails on start-up, set the corresponding variable "mrcprecog" to NULL.
    * Differentiate the cases when recognition is terminated due to an error or caller hang-up. In the latter case, the variable "RECOGSTATUS" is set to the new status "INTERRUPTED".
    * Dropped support for the barge-in handled on/by Asterisk (bargein=2). The option bargein can now simply be enabled (1) or disabled (0).
    * Set the dialplan variables "RECOG_COMPLETION_CAUSE", "RECOG_RESULT", and optionally "RECOG_WAVEFORM_URI" in accordance with the application SynthAndRecog().
    * Added support for the method "Start-Input-Timers".
    * Took out the input option "sit", since the header field "START-INPUT-TIMERS" is now set and controlled implicitly by the application.

  2.3. SynthAndRecog()

    * Added support for prompts referenced by a URI.
    * Added a new option "uer" (URI-encoded results). By default, this option is disabled (uer=0). If the option is enabled (uer=1), the variable "RECOG_RESULT" holds URI-encoded results. This matters in case of the AMI use.
    * Differentiate the cases when recognition is terminated due to an error or caller hang-up. In the latter case, the variable "RECOG_STATUS" is set to the new status "INTERRUPTED".

3. Miscellaneous

    * Terminate the MRCP session when negotiated codec descriptor cannot be retrieved by a user application.
    * Prevent a possible segfault of Asterisk caused by malformed input parameters (Issue-157).
    * Added a new enumeration speech_channel_status_t used by the applications to set the corresponding status variable on exit.
    * Fixed possible memory leaks in the processing of ast_frames.
    * Added new dialplan functions RECOG_CONFIDENCE(), RECOG_GRAMMAR(), RECOG_INPUT(), and RECOG_INSTANCE() to retrieve recognition results set by the applications MRCPRecog() and SynthAndRecog().
    * Updated the XML documentation of the dialplan applications and custom functions.
    * Improved the log statements.
    * Added more usage examples and helper macros which output recognition results by using the new dialplan functions.
    * Normalize application input arguments by stripping any leading and trailing whitespaces and skipping the quotes.


Changes for Asterisk UniMRCP Modules 1.0.0

1. Generic Speech Recognition API (res_speech_unimrcp.so)

  * Handled change to the apt_log_file_open() function. Thanks J.W.F. Thirion.
  * Added the ability to implicitly stop an in-progress recognition request. Applied a reworked patch submitted to Issue-105. Thanks Borja.
  * Added support for loading and activating multiple grammars for a recognition request. Applied a reworked patch submitted to Issue-105. Thanks Borja.
  * Enhanced parsing of NLSML results. Applied a patch submitted to Issue-105. Thanks Borja.
  * Fixed support for built-in grammars. Thanks Renato.

2. Dialplan Applications (app_unimrcp.so)

  2.1. MRCPSynth()

    * Fixed a DTMF generator issue. Thanks J.W.F. Thirion.
    * Added the ability to load a plain text or an SSML content from the specified file. Applied a reworked patch submitted to Issue-151. Thanks Borja.

  2.2. MRCPRecog()

    * Fixed a misspelled name of the header field "Input-Waveform-URI".
    * Use the option "sl" for the header field "Sensitivity-Level" and "spl" for "Speech-Language".
    * Fixed a crash in speech_channel_destroy(). Thanks Evan, Stephen, and Rodolfo.
    * Fixed a memory leak in processing of recognition results. A recognition result is now allocated from the channel memory pool using apr_pstrdup(). Otherwise, the duplicated string should have been explicitly freed.
    * Fixed the grammar type detection routine.
    * Added the ability to load a prompt and/or a grammar from the specified files.
    * Added support for loading and activating multiple grammars for a recognition request. The grammars can be specified as a comma-separated list of input parameters.
    * Added a new application option: exit-on-play-error "epe". If the option is enabled and the specified prompt file cannot be played, the application exits with the "RECOGSTATUS" variable set to "ERROR".

  2.3. SynthAndRecog()

    This is a new diaplan application which plays a synthesized prompt to the user and waits for speech to be recognized. The application supports the following features:

    * Plain text and SSML prompts.
    * Inline (SRGS XML, SRGS ABNF, JSGF), built-in, and URI grammars. Inline grammars can be loaded from a file. A list of comma-separated grammars can be used for a recognition request.
    * Barge-in, and an option for non-bargeinable prompts.
    * Recognition timers.
    * Recognition results.

3. Miscellaneous

  * Enhanced the version detection routine of Asterisk (asterisk.m4).
  * Added a new optional parameter to the configure script --with-asterisk-version, which allows to explicitly specify a version string in case the version cannot be determined or retrieved implicitly.
  * Included asterisk.m4 from acinclude.m4.
  * Added a new header file ast_compat_def.h, which provides backward compatible macros, definitions, and utility functions for Asterisk.
  * Added support for Asterisk 1.8, 10, and 11 to the modules res_speech-unimrcp and app_unimrcp. The former versions are also supported.
  * Added support for auto-generated XML doc files introduced since Asterisk 1.6. The XML doc files are generated from the corresponding tags declared in source files.
  * Split the module app_unimrcp into several integral parts. The source file app_unimrcp.c is now the entry point of the module, and the applications reside in separate source files.
  * Fixed loading of the configuration parameter "offer-new-connection" to accept both boolean "true" or "false" and integer "1" or "0" values.
  * Added a checking for pkg-config to the configure script.
  * Added a new sample dialplan applications file mrcp_sample_apps.conf which provides numerous usage examples. Removed the old file say-digit.conf.
  * For logging purposes, set the name of a UniMRCP session object to schannel->name.
  * Using transparent header fields to apply application options.
  * Retained backward compatibility with UniMRCP 1.0.0 and above, but dropped the support for earlier versions.
  * Updated the README file to include the statement for the GPLv2 license. Added the INSTALL and COPYING files.
