== Details ==
==1. Obtain Source ==
===Download Source Tarball ===
Use the link below to download source tarball
    http://code.google.com/p/unimrcp/downloads/list

===Checkout Source via SVN ===
Use the command below to anonymously checkout the latest source code
    svn checkout http://unimrcp.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ unimrcp

==2. Build Source ==
===Requirements ===
UniMRCP depends on a number of third party tools and libraries,
which must be installed prior to UniMRCP build.

1. Apache Portable Runtime [>=1.2.x] (http://apr.apache.org/). Whenever you want to build any part of UniMRCP, you need the Apache Portable Runtime (APR) and the APR Utility (APR-util) libraries.

2. Sofia-SIP [>=1.12.6] (http://sofia-sip.sourceforge.net/). Sofia-SIP library is used to implement MRCPv2 specification compliant SIP signaling. Sofia-SIP is an open-source SIP User-Agent library, compliant with the IETF RFC3261 specification.

===GNU Build (Linux and other Unix variants)===
====Additional requirements====
  * autoconf 2.57 or newer
  * libtool 1.4 or newer

====Build procedure====
{{{
$ ./bootstrap
$ ./configure
$ make
$ make install
}}}

====Installed directory layout====
By default project will be installed in /usr/local/unimrcp directory with the following layout
{{{
bin      - binaries (unimrcpserver, unimrcpclient)
conf     - configuration files
include  - header files
libs     - shared (convenient) libraries
plugins  - run-time loadable modules
}}}

====Configure options====
  * To explicitly specify where to look for the APR and APR-util libraries use the "--with-apr=" and "--with-apr-util=" options:
    $ ./configure --with-apr=/usr/local/apr --with-apr-util=/usr/local/apr

  * To explicitly specify where to look for the Sofia-SIP library use the "--with-sofia-sip=" option:
    $ ./configure --with-sofia-sip=/usr/local/sofia-sip

====Makefile rules====
  * To install the default configuration use:
    $ make def-conf

  * To generate doxygen documentation from the source use:
    $ make dox

  * To build distribution tarball use:
    $ make dist


===VS2005 Build (Windows XP, Vista, ...)===
====Additional requirements====
  * Microsoft Visual Studio 2005

====One-time pre-build preparation====
  * To specify where to look for the APR and APR-util libraries use apr.vsprops located in build/vsprops:
{{{
	<UserMacro
		Name="AprDir"
		Value="$(SolutionDir)libs\apr"
	/>
	<UserMacro
		Name="AprUtilDir"
		Value="$(SolutionDir)libs\apr-util"
	/>
}}}
  * To specify where to look for the Sofia-SIP library use sofiasip.vsprops located in build/vsprops:
{{{
	<UserMacro
		Name="SofiaDir"
		Value="$(SolutionDir)libs\sofia-sip"
	/>
}}}

====Build procedure====
  * Open unimrcp.sln solution file.
  * Build prebuild.vcproj utility project (right click on tools -> prebuild in Solution Explorer and select Build from context menu).
    This is a one-time output directory preparation. It copies all the required APR and SofiaSIP libraries and the default configuration to the output directory.
  * Build the solution (Build -> Build Solution).

====Output directory layout====
{{{
bin      - binaries (unimrcpserver, unimrcpclient) and all the required dlls
conf     - configuration files
plugins  - run-time loadable modules
}}}
